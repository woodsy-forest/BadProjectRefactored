//
// Refactor the AdvertisementService
// (It works, but the quality of the code is very poor)
//
// Find the problems, refactor it, make it better
// Use TDD, SOLID principles, Clean Code, etc.
//
// Requirements:
// - The AdvertisementService must have a "public Advertisement GetAdvertisement(string id)" method
// - Modification of the ThirdParty project is not allowed
// - Anything else (new classes, methods, tests, etc) are welcome if required
